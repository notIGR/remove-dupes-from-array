# Getting started

In this exercise, you will created a function `noDupes` that will remove all duplicates from an array, and return the new array

** Try to do this without viewing any test cases in the tests directory, but you are to view if neccesary **

After cloning, run `npm install` to install required dependencies
From there, see `script.js` for instructions on this practice

## Testing

To test your function for both numbers and strings, use `npm run tests`

To test your `noDupes` function against arrays of numbers, use `npm run numbers`

To test against arrays of strings, use `npm run strings`
